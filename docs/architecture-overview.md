# VibeChess Architecture Overview: Redis, SignalR & ASP.NET Core

## 🎯 Purpose

This document explains how Redis, SignalR, and ASP.NET Core work together in the VibeChess multiplayer chess application. Understanding these interactions is crucial for building and maintaining real-time multiplayer features.

## 🔴 Redis - The Data Store

### What Redis Does

- Acts as an in-memory database (super fast read/write operations)
- Stores temporary game state, player sessions, and lobby data
- Acts as "shared memory" between multiple server instances
- Provides pub/sub capabilities for real-time notifications

### In VibeChess Context

```
Data Storage Examples:
├── Player Sessions: "user:123" → { playerId, gameId, isActive, connectionId }
├── Game State: "game:abc" → { boardFEN, currentTurn, players, timer, moves[] }
├── Lobbies: "lobby:xyz" → { players[], gameMode, settings, status }
├── Active Games: "games:active" → Set of active game IDs
└── Player Connections: "connections" → Map of connectionId to playerId
```

### Key Redis Features Used

- **Sets**: Track active games, players in lobbies
- **Hash Maps**: Store complex game objects
- **Expiration**: Auto-cleanup of abandoned games
- **Atomic Operations**: Ensure data consistency during concurrent access

**Think of Redis like a giant shared notepad that all your servers can read/write to instantly.**

## 📡 SignalR - Real-time Communication

### What SignalR Does

- Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between client and server
- Automatically handles WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or polling as fallback
- Groups connections into "rooms" (like game rooms or lobby rooms)
- Manages connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect)

### In VibeChess Context

```
Real-time Events:
├── Game Events
│   ├── PlayerMoved: Broadcast move to all players in game
│   ├── GameStarted: Notify players when game begins
│   ├── GameEnded: Broadcast game result
│   └── TimerUpdate: Real-time timer synchronization
├── Lobby Events
│   ├── PlayerJoined: Update lobby player list
│   ├── PlayerLeft: Remove player from lobby view
│   └── LobbySettingsChanged: Sync lobby configuration
└── Connection Events
    ├── PlayerConnected: Handle player coming online
    ├── PlayerDisconnected: Handle graceful/ungraceful disconnection
    └── Reconnection: Restore player state after network issues
```

### SignalR Groups/Rooms

```
Connection Grouping:
├── Game Room: "game_{gameId}" → All players + spectators in that game
├── Lobby Room: "lobby_{lobbyId}" → All players in that lobby
└── User Room: "user_{userId}" → Personal notifications for that user
```

**Think of SignalR like a phone conference call where everyone can talk and listen simultaneously.**

## 🌐 ASP.NET Core - The Orchestrator

### What ASP.NET Core Does

- Handles HTTP requests (REST API endpoints)
- Hosts SignalR hubs for real-time communication
- Manages business logic, validation, and authentication
- Coordinates data flow between Redis and SignalR
- Provides dependency injection for services

### In VibeChess Context

```
Service Architecture:
├── Controllers (REST API)
│   ├── AuthController: Login, registration
│   ├── LobbyController: Create/join lobbies
│   └── GameController: Game management
├── SignalR Hubs
│   ├── GameHub: Real-time game interactions
│   └── LobbyHub: Real-time lobby interactions
├── Services (Business Logic)
│   ├── ChessValidationService: Move validation
│   ├── GameService: Game state management
│   ├── LobbyService: Lobby management
│   └── RedisService: Data persistence
└── Models
    ├── Game entities
    ├── Player entities
    └── DTOs for API responses
```

---

## 🔄 How They Work Together

### Example Flow: Player Makes a Chess Move

```
1. 🖥️  CLIENT (Frontend)
   │   User clicks to move piece from e2 to e4
   ↓   SignalR message: "MakeMove" { from: "e2", to: "e4" }

2. 📡 ASP.NET SIGNALR HUB (GameHub)
   │   Receives move request
   │   Validates user is in the game
   ↓   Calls business logic service

3. ⚙️  ASP.NET SERVICE LAYER (GameService)
   │   Validates move legality
   │   Checks if it's player's turn
   ↓   Requests current game state from Redis

4. 🔴 REDIS
   │   Returns current game state
   ↓   { boardFEN, currentTurn, players, timer }

5. ⚙️  ASP.NET SERVICE LAYER (ChessValidationService)
   │   Validates move using ChessDotNet
   │   Calculates new board state
   │   Updates game state object
   ↓   Saves updated state to Redis

6. 🔴 REDIS
   │   Confirms save operation
   ↓   Returns success/failure

7. 📡 ASP.NET SIGNALR HUB (GameHub)
   │   Prepares broadcast message
   │   Sends to all players in game room
   ↓   Broadcasts: "MoveMade" { move, newBoard, gameState }

8. 🖥️  ALL CLIENTS in Game Room
   │   Receive updated board state
   │   Update UI with new piece positions
   └   Show move animation
```

### Data Consistency Flow

```
Write Operation:
Redis ← ASP.NET Service ← SignalR Hub ← Client

Read Operation:
Client → SignalR Hub → ASP.NET Service → Redis

Broadcast:
Redis → ASP.NET Service → SignalR Hub → All Connected Clients
```

## 🎯 Where to Start Learning

### Phase 1: Understand the Concepts (Don't Code Yet!)

1. **Data Flow Mapping**

   - What data needs to be stored? (games, players, moves, timers)
   - What data needs to be real-time? (moves, player status, timers)
   - What data persists vs. temporary? (game history vs. current state)

2. **User Interaction Mapping**
   - Player joins lobby → needs real-time updates of other players
   - Player makes move → needs immediate feedback + opponent notification
   - Player disconnects → needs graceful handling and opponent notification
   - Spectator joins → needs current game state without affecting gameplay

### Phase 2: Design Questions (Before Implementation)

#### Redis Questions

- What happens if Redis goes down? Do we lose all active games?
- How long should we keep game data in memory?
- Should we store the entire game history or just current position?
- How do we handle concurrent moves (race conditions)?

#### SignalR Questions

- What happens when a player disconnects mid-game?
- Should spectators get the same updates as players?
- How do we prevent cheating (server-side validation)?
- How do we handle reconnections gracefully?

#### Integration Questions

- Should REST API and SignalR share the same business logic?
- How do we test real-time features effectively?
- What if multiple servers are running - how do they coordinate?
- How do we scale horizontally (multiple server instances)?

### Phase 3: Progressive Learning Path

#### Week 1: Simple SignalR Chat

- Build a basic chat room with SignalR
- No Redis, just in-memory state
- Learn connection management and broadcasting

#### Week 2: Add Redis to Chat

- Store chat history in Redis
- Handle server restarts gracefully
- Learn Redis data structures

#### Week 3: Turn-Based Game

- Apply patterns to a simple turn-based game (tic-tac-toe)
- Add game rooms and player management
- Implement basic validation

#### Week 4: Chess-Specific Features

- Integrate chess validation
- Add timers and complex game states
- Handle chess-specific edge cases

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### Scalability Patterns

```
Single Server:
Client ↔ ASP.NET (SignalR + Services) ↔ Redis

Multiple Servers:
Client ↔ Load Balancer ↔ ASP.NET Server 1 ↔ Redis
                      ↔ ASP.NET Server 2 ↔ Redis
                      ↔ ASP.NET Server 3 ↔ Redis
```

### Error Handling Strategies

- **Network Issues**: Automatic reconnection with state restoration
- **Redis Failures**: Graceful degradation or failover
- **Server Crashes**: Game state recovery from Redis
- **Invalid Moves**: Client-side prediction with server validation

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Verify user identity before game actions
- **Authorization**: Ensure players can only move their own pieces
- **Validation**: All moves validated server-side regardless of client state
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam moves or connection abuse
